Their primary focus was on diplomacy, knowledge, and the Force rather than combat. Consulars were deeply attuned to the Force, using it to promote peace, resolve conflicts, and mediate disputes. They often served as ambassadors, negotiators, and scholars, working to maintain stability and balance in the galaxy through nonviolent means.<br><br>Consulars were also dedicated to studying the mysteries of the Force and its many aspects, including its connection to life, the universe, and the living Force. They typically wielded lightsabers as a means of defense, but they preferred non-aggressive solutions over fighting. In battle, they used their connection to the Force to manipulate situations, protect allies, and subdue opponents rather than seeking to defeat them.<br><br>In essence, Jedi Consulars were the peacekeepers and intellectuals of the Jedi Order, prioritizing wisdom, understanding, and the avoidance of conflict whenever possible. They played key roles in times of peace and during diplomatic crises.</p></div><div class="tab-panel"><p>Jedi Guardians were one of the primary branches within the Jedi Order, focused on combat, defense, and protecting the galaxy from threats. Their main responsibility was to fight in battle, defend the weak, and uphold the peace through strength and skill in lightsaber combat. Guardians were highly trained in various forms of martial arts, particularly lightsaber techniques, and were often on the front lines during wars and conflicts.<br><br>While they were skilled in diplomacy and negotiation, their main strength was their ability to protect others and defeat enemies when necessary. Guardians were often tasked with leading troops, guarding important locations, or defending the Jedi Temple and other key assets.<br><br>The Jedi Guardians were more likely to be involved in active combat situations than other Jedi, such as the more peace-focused Consulars or the investigative Sentinels. They embodied the warrior aspect of the Jedi Order, balancing their role as defenders with their strong commitment to justice and peace.</p></div><div class="tab-panel"><p>Jedi Sentinels were a unique and balanced branch of the Jedi Order, focused on both combat and specialized skills, often working in areas that required versatility and adaptability. They acted as a middle ground between the Jedi Guardians and Jedi Consulars, combining the martial abilities of Guardians with the investigative and analytical skills of Consulars.<br><br>Sentinels were trained to be problem-solvers and often handled situations that required a combination of physical prowess and keen insight. They excelled in dealing with threats that involved espionage, sabotage, or other covert operations, and frequently worked in the shadows to protect the galaxy from hidden dangers.<br><br>Their skills extended beyond lightsaber combat; they were proficient in various forms of technology, security systems, and the use of the Force for practical purposes. Sentinels were also responsible for rooting out corruption and ensuring that the Jedi Order remained true to its principles, often acting as watchdogs or troubleshooters in a galaxy filled with intrigue.<br><br>In essence, Jedi Sentinels were highly adaptable, focused on maintaining the balance between peacekeeping, defense, and investigation, making them a vital part of the Jedi Order.</p></div></div></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Made by zet</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://tjoarchive.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://tjoarchive.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=700105c316933a8202041b6415abb233"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
